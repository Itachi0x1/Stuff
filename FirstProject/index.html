<h3>Reading</h3>
<p>I read fiction and non-fiction, but mainly non-fiction. I usually read Computing 
    books but anything that increases my knowledge is good too.
</p>

<h3>Going to the gym</h3>
<p>I enjoy working out. It keeps me fit and it also helps me get my mind off things.</p>

<h3>Going out with friends</h3>
<p>There's nothing wrong with getting out and about with friends.</p>

<h3>Going for walks</h3>
<p>Getting some fresh air doesn't hurt.</p>

<h3>Learning new things</h3>
<p>Whether its in Computing or a completely different area, I enjoy learning new things.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>Coding, I find interesting. I enjoy it. I enjoy C++ the most though. I think the syntax is pretty.</p>
